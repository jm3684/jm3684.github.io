        <main><h3><em>Educator Credentials</em></h3>
            <p>My name is <strong>Jessie McCloy</strong>. I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri. I hope to gain my MLIS degree by the end of 2024. I received my bachelor’s degree in English from the University of Nebraska. I have loved libraries, archives, and museums my entire life. I currently work at Southeast Community College library. I’ve worked there full-time for a little over a year. I have past experience working in archives and museums such as the International Quilt Museum, the National Roller-Skating Museum, and UNL Special Collections. In my spare time, I like to build LEGOs, quilt, and read. I like to broaden my horizons by reading a lot of different types of books, including non-fiction. I’m passionate about traveling, but due to time and financial constraints, books tend to be the easiest way for me to visit other places.</p>
