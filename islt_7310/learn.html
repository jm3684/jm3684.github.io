            <p>The Golden Age takes place from 1938 to 1956. Many different genres of
            comic books became extremely popular during this era, including romance, crime,
            western, horror, and superheroes. Two of the most popular publishers of superhero
            comics were created in this era. National Comics (Later DC) and Timely Comics (Later
            Marvel) were both producing comic book characters that remain popular and well-read
            to this day. The most popular heroes to come out during this time are Superman,
            Batman, Wonder Woman, and Captain America. Important writers include Bob Kane, Bill
            Finger, Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, Jack Kirby, and Joe Simon. Although women in comics
            were not as common due to overt sexism in the industry, some women did make an
            impact on the comic book industry such as Toni Blum, Lily Renee, and Tarpe Mills.</p>

            <p>The Silver Age takes place from 1956-1970. This era is characterized by
            declining comic books sales after WWII. It is also the era in which the Comic Code
            Authority came into effect. Due to the works of psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, comic
            books were targeted as corrupting the youth of America as talked about in Wertham’s
            book, Seduction of the Innocent. This regulation led to the death of many publishers,
            especially those focused on crime and horror comics. The superhero genre faired better.
            Writers such as Stan Lee, who grew up in the Golden Age, were now creating superhero
            legends such as the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man.</p>

            <p>The Bronze Age took place between 1970-1985. Artists and writers at this
            time could take more liberties with comic books as the Comics Code Authority Standards
            became more relaxed before disbanding altogether. In this new era, comics tended to be
            darker and more “realistic.” Comics at this time also dealt with social issues as can be
            seen in Green Lantern/Green Arrow series where they confront racism, drug addiction,
            and pollution. It was perhaps due to this new social awareness that heroes of color
            started to appear such as Luke Cage, John Stewart, and Shang-Chi. Popular artists </p>

            <p>The Modern Age is classified as anything from 1996 to the present. This age
            is marked not only with comic books, but the adaptations in television and movies from
            Batman and Robin (1997) to Arrow (2012-2020). These adaptations have been viewed
            with mixed results, but have made the superhero comic book genre very popular in the
            mainstream. The Modern Era has also been a landmark for Marvel Comics and DC. For
            DC, Action Comics and Detective Comics have passed the 1,000 issues mark in 2018
            and 2019, respectively. Marvel Comics, once on the verge of bankruptcy, has expanded
            into the MCU once acquired by the Disney Corporation. Popular writers and artists at
            this time include Todd McFarlane, Tom King, G. Willow Wilson, and many, many, more. </p>
